## A Chat With Redux

#### React
Hey CourseAction, someone clicked this "Save Course" button.

#### Action
Thanks React! I will dispatch an action so reducers that care can update the state.

#### Reducer
Ah, thanks action. I see you passed me the current state and the action to perform. I'll make a new copy of the state and return it.

#### Store
Thanks for updating the state reducer. I'll make sure that all connected components are aware.

#### React-Redux
Woah, thanks for the new data Mr. Store. I'll now intelligently determine if I should tell React about this change so that it only has to bother with updating the UI when necessary.

#### React
Ooo! Shiny new data has been passed down via props from the store! I'll update the UI to reflect this!
